# **About me & my reserach**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Biodiversity Research Institute (IMIB). I obtained in December 2021 the PhD degree in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (cum laude). I also hold an MSc in Applied Research in Wildlife and Game Resources (2017) and a BSc in Environmental Sciences (2016). I have published 32 peer-reviewed publications (25 of them Q1, 12 as first/corresponding aurthor), and 12 scientific reports. I have lectured for 215 hours at the Bsc and Master level. I have also supervised 11 bachelor/master students, hosted one PhD student, and one postdoctoral researchers, and co-supervised chapters of four PhD thesis. I have received 292,655.70€ in competitive calls as principal investigator (PI)/beneficiary. I have been PI of four projects calls, and I have collaborated as a researcher on seven projects and 10 transfer of knowledge contracts. I have contributed with 47 presentations at national/international congresses. Regarding international mobility, I have been funded in competitive calls to visit four universities and research institutions abroad for a total period of 33 months (9 pre-doc + 24 post-doc) at the Zoological Society of London (UK), Uni. of St. Andrews (UK), Uni. of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden) and Uni. of Torino (Italy). I have published articles with 112 international researchers. I am associate editor of the journal Ecosystems edited by the Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology, and I have served on the evaluation committee for one competitive project call. I have been a member of the organizing committee of two scientific congresses, and one of the scientific committees. I am also a member of the European Observatory of Wildlife (EOW) advisory board, a European network capable of monitoring wildlife populations. I give particular attention to communicating and disseminating research, interacting frequently with the media (e.g. El País) and managing an X account (@cameratraps1) with > 2,1K followers in which I disseminate information about wildlife, camera traps and research. I usually transfer my knowledge to the international and national levels in the form of courses and workshops. For instance, I have been invited as a keynote speaker to seminars organized by Imperial College of London, veterinarians and engineering associations, and workshops hosted by ENETWILD project, Mammalnet CitSci project and Palombar NGO. I have received the “Seal of Excellence” in my project proposal “One health: tick-borne pathogens in the context of a wildlife pandemic” in Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships 2022 (MSCA-PF). I have been also awarded extraordinary prices on the Bachelor, Master and PhD levels.
