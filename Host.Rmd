# **Host**

### *Pedro Girotti*

<div class="col-sm-7">
[Mr Girotti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro-Girotti) is a PhD student affiliated at the University of Tuscia in Italy. He is interested in monitoring ungulates populations in central Italy using camera traps. During his visit, we worked on REST and REM, and I also took the opportunity to introduce him to photogrammetry.

### *Alí Çelík*

<div class="col-sm-7">
[Mr Çelik](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali-Celik-18) is a PhD student affiliated at Karadeniz Technical University in Turkey.He is interested in monitoring red deer populations in Turkey. During his visit, we worked on designing a camera trapping experiment to monitor red deer and predators (in his study area, the presence of wolves, bears, jackals and feral dogs is common!).

### *Radim Plhal*

<div class="col-sm-7">
[Dr Plhal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radim-Plhal) is a postdoctoral researcher affiliated at Mendel University in Brno.He is interested in wild boar ecology, with a especial interest in management. During his visit, we worked on designing program to monitor wild boar population in Czech Republic. We also found time for a couple of days on the field, and even more relevant... he discovered 'sidra' and enjoyed Asturian gastronomy.

### *Mery Escobar*


[Miss Escobar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radim-Plhal) is a PhD student affiliated at Autonomus Univesity of Barcelona. She is interested in urban and peri-urban wild boar populations in the area of Barcelona (Spain) (Did you know that one of these wild boars stole Shakira's mobile?? [See here](https://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/gente/shakira-fue-atacada-por-jabalies-en-parque-de-barcelona/). During his visit, we worked on the analysis of camera trapping data, especially focused on estimate population density applying random encounter model. Mery also joined in the experiments we had going on...as this picture (almost!) proves.
