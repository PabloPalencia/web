# **Narrative description**
My research is focused on developing and fine-tuning cutting-edge tools for wildlife management and conservation. I could highlight three research lines. Below you can find a short description of the main research lines in which I focus my research

## **Impact of diversionary feeding at population level**
<br/>
Recent studies concluded that ground-nesting birds are 86 % more likely to decline than birds with other nesting strategies, and indeed, 74% of ground-nesting species were in decline. Predator control has been traditionally used, but this is controversial, cost-prohibitive and has ethical limitations. In this context, **diversionary feeding** (deliberate provisioning of food to explore the propensity of individuals to exploit the most easily accessed resource)
