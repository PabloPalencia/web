# **Narrative description**
My research is focused on developing and fine-tuning cutting-edge tools for wildlife management and conservation. I could highlight three research lines. Below you can find a short description of the main research lines in which I focus my research.

## **Impact of diversionary feeding at population level**
<br/>
Recent studies concluded that ground-nesting birds are 86 % more likely to decline than birds with other nesting strategies, and indeed, 74% of ground-nesting species were in decline. Predator control has been traditionally used, but this is controversial, cost-prohibitive and has ethical limitations. In this context, **diversionary feeding** (deliberate provisioning of food to explore the propensity of individuals to exploit the most easily accessed resource). In collaboration with colleagues from [IREC](https://www.irec.es/) we are assessing a key question about diversionary feeding: how diversionary feeding affects in terms of abundance, aggregation, occupancy, etc predators' populations. 

## **Utility of diversionary feeding on reducing predators impact on ground-nesting birds**
<br/>

## **Camera trapping box: survey design, camera performance, etc.**
<br/>

## **African swine fever emergence**
<br/>

## **Density estimation & unmarked populations**
<br/>

## **Camera trapping & movement ecology**
<br/>

## **Integrated wildlife monitoring**
Integrated wildlife monitoring merges wildlife health and host community monitoring for effective disease management and prevention. I did my PhD in a “health and biotechnology group [(SaBio)](https://www.irec.es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/sanidad-y-biotecnologia-sabio/)”, and my first postdoc in a Veterinary Faculty [(UniTo)](https://www.clmveterinaria.unito.it/do/home.pl), so I have led the host community monitoring in several studies. I have worked with shared diseases between wildlife and livestock such as African swine fever (ASF), bovine tuberculosis, sarcoptic mange, toxoplasma gondii or bluetongue among others.Special mention requires ASF, a virus causing 90% mortality in wild boar and pigs. I dedicated my first postdoc at the University of Turin to design, implement (in collaboration with Italian authorities) and fine-tuning an integrated wildlife monitoring program to monitor the spread of the virus in the infected populations of Italy.
