# **Narrative description**
My research is focused on **developing and fine-tuning cutting-edge tools for wildlife management and conservation**. Below you can find a short description of the main research lines in which I focus my research.

## **Impact of diversionary feeding at population level**
<br/>
Recent studies concluded that ground-nesting birds are 86 % more likely to decline than birds with other nesting strategies, and indeed, 74% of ground-nesting species were in decline. Predator control has been traditionally used, but this is controversial, cost-prohibitive and has ethical limitations. In this context, **diversionary feeding** (deliberate provisioning of food to explore the propensity of individuals to exploit the most easily accessed resource). In collaboration with colleagues from [IREC](https://www.irec.es/) we are assessing a key question about diversionary feeding: how diversionary feeding affects in terms of abundance, aggregation, occupancy, etc predators' populations.

## **Utility of diversionary feeding on reducing predators impact on ground-nesting birds**
Related to the previous section, I am also assessing the utility of diversionary feeding to reduce the predators impact on ground nest. Particularly, I am working in the Pyreens and Cantabrian Mountains, where capercaillie (*Tetrao urogallus*) is experiencing a strong decline.

## **Camera trapping box: survey design, camera performance, etc.**
I have worked (and continue to work) on various jobs related to the operation of cameras, and key points when designing a photo-trapping studio. From an experiment in which we compared various camera traps (including Reconyx, Bushnell, Scoutguard, Ltl Acorn and Keepguard) and identified the main factors that determine whether an animal passes in front of a camera and is detected (or not). Spoiler, cameras miss a lot more than they detect!
And also other work in which we evaluated the effect of placing three cameras per sampling point (not in the same tree, but in the surrounding area) on detection rates. Also the effect of changing camera locations instead of keeping them fixed for the whole study period, etc.

## **African swine fever emergence**
African swine fever (ASF) is a virus causing 90% mortality in wild boar and domestic pigs. During my first postdoc, I focused my research to monitor wild boar populations in north Italy, were the first case of an infected wild boar was reported just 15 days after my thesis viva. Capanne di Marcarolo Natural Park was one of our study areas.

## **Density estimation & unmarked populations**
<br/>

## **Camera trapping & movement ecology**
Capturing and tagging with telemetry wild animals is time-consuming and not flexible in some situations. Expanding the utility of camera trapping in movement ecology studies is something in which I am particularly interested. 
<br/>

## **Integrated wildlife monitoring**
Integrated wildlife monitoring merges wildlife health and host community monitoring for effective disease management and prevention. I did my PhD in a “health and biotechnology group [(SaBio)](https://www.irec.es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/sanidad-y-biotecnologia-sabio/)”, and my first postdoc in a Veterinary Faculty [(UniTo)](https://www.clmveterinaria.unito.it/do/home.pl), so I have led the host community monitoring in several studies. I have worked with shared diseases between wildlife and livestock such as African swine fever (ASF), bovine tuberculosis, sarcoptic mange, toxoplasma gondii or bluetongue among others. I dedicated my first postdoc at the University of Turin to design, implement (in collaboration with Italian authorities) and fine-tuning an integrated wildlife monitoring program to monitor the spread of ASF in the infected populations of Italy.
