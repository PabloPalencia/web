## **Impact of diversionary feeding at population level**
<br/>
Recent studies concluded that ground-nesting birds are 86 % more likely to decline than birds with other nesting strategies, and indeed, 74% of ground-nesting species were in decline. Predator control has been traditionally used, but this is controversial, cost-prohibitive and has ethical limitations. In this context, **diversionary feeding** (deliberate provisioning of food to explore the propensity of individuals to exploit the most easily accessed resource). In collaboration with colleagues from [IREC](https://www.irec.es/) we are assessing a key question about diversionary feeding: how diversionary feeding affects in terms of abundance, aggregation, occupancy, etc predators' populations.

## **African swine fever emergence**
African swine fever (ASF) is a virus causing 90% mortality in wild boar and domestic pigs. During my first postdoc, I focused my research to monitor wild boar populations in north Italy, were the first case of an infected wild boar was reported just 15 days after my thesis viva. Capanne di Marcarolo Natural Park was one of our study areas.

## **Integrated wildlife monitoring**
Integrated wildlife monitoring merges wildlife health and host community monitoring for effective disease management and prevention. I did my PhD in a “health and biotechnology group [(SaBio)](https://www.irec.es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/sanidad-y-biotecnologia-sabio/)”, and my first postdoc in a Veterinary Faculty [(UniTo)](https://www.clmveterinaria.unito.it/do/home.pl), so I have led the host community monitoring in several studies. I have worked with shared diseases between wildlife and livestock such as African swine fever (ASF), bovine tuberculosis, sarcoptic mange, toxoplasma gondii or bluetongue among others. I dedicated my first postdoc at the University of Turin to design, implement (in collaboration with Italian authorities) and fine-tuning an integrated wildlife monitoring program to monitor the spread of ASF in the infected populations of Italy.
